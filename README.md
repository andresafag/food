# Foodmania is an immersive culinary experience

Have you ever wonder what ingredients to use or how long it takes to cook certain dishes?. My wife has, so I decided to create a website to showcase exactly that along with cooking techniques and interesting food facts to add more fun to it.

## About the project
It all started when my wife, who's a chef, wanted me to come up with an effecient and simple way to know the basic things about known dishes such as ingredients and preparing steps without worrying too much about researching all over the intenet. 

After some research I found an API called [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) which offeres the endpoints required for what I wanted to create and ended up implementing it. SPECIAL THANKS TO THE CREATORS OF THIS API, VERY HELPFUL AND INFORMATIVE. 

## Usage
This projects is divided into 3 sections as described below:

 1. **Index**   

The main/index page is basically where all the magic happens. As soon as you type the dish or key word you want the information for and click on the Yummy button you will be seeing the recipes showing the ingredients as well as the preparation and the time to cook it.

 2. **Food facts**

In here your mind will be blown away by some interesting food facts you probably did not know or heard about before.

 3. **Cooking techniques**
 
There's nothing that saves more time than the know how or techniques passed along by other people in our society. Why re-inventing the wheel if somebody else came up with that knowledge already.

I'll brake down the parts of the page
