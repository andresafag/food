## Foodmania: An Immersive Culinary Experience

Have you ever wondered what ingredients to use or how long it takes to cook certain dishes? My wife has, so I decided to create a website to showcase exactly that along with cooking techniques and more.

## About the Project

It all started when my wife, who's a chef, wanted an efficient and simple way to know the basic things about known dishes such as ingredients and preparation steps without worrying. After some research, I found an API called [spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) which offers extensive food data.

## Usage

This project is divided into 3 sections as described below:

1. **Index**   
   The main/index page is where all the magic happens. As soon as you type the dish or keyword you want information for and click on the Yummy button, you will see the recipes shown.

2. **Food Facts**   
   Here, your mind will be blown away by some interesting food facts you probably didn't know or haven't heard about before.

3. **Cooking Techniques**   
   There's nothing that saves more time than the know-how or techniques passed along by other people in our society. Why reinvent the wheel if somebody else has already come up with that knowledge?

Every time we load the food fun facts and cooking techniques, some random information is pulled from the database.
